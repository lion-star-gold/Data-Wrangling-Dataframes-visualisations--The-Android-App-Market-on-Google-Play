# The-Android-App-Market-on-Google-Play
Code for my DataCamp project, 'The Android App Market on Google Play'. Both Guided and Unguided projects.

## Overall Description
The skills developed in DataCamp's 'Python Data Science Toolbox (Part 1)' and 'Joining Data with pandas' courses are used to wrangle data and carry out a descriptive and inferential analysis, alongside visualisation of the dataframe.
A project presenting skills in Data Wrangling, Visualisation, and Analysis

### A - Guided Project 📝
1. Import data, drop duplicate rows, and inspect the data
2. Clean the dataset
3. Correct data types
4. Explore app categories
5. Examine distribution of app ratings
6. Note the size and price of an app
7. Relationship between app category and app price
8. Filter out 'junk' apps
9. Popularity of paid apps vs free apps
10. Sentiment analysis of user reviews

### B - Unguided Project 📝🌟
A real-world type setting where the analyst is asked to present an analysis of Google Play apps, giving the team a comprehensive overview of different categories of apps, ratings, and other metrics.

1. Import the data and clean the columns as required
2. Find the number of apps in each category, the average price, and the average rating
3. Find the top 10 free finance apps with the highest average sentiment score.
